## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

The main struggle I had setting up git and Github was the syncing of the SSH keys. I kept accidentally creating new ones and not saving the private keys, and the SSH keys would not work.

The difference between git and Github is that Github is the actual site where the files and changes to a project are committed to, and git is the program installed on the user's actual computer to let them push/sync/commit to Github.

Developers use version control to be able to see which changes were made and in which version. It does make sense to me, because developers might want to go back and see which changes were made to see what went wrong.
